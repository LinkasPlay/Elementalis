<h2> Technical </h2><br>
<p>◆ WORK IN PROGRESS<br>
	◾ <br>
	◾</p><br><br>
	<h3> Bosses </h3>
	<h4> How it works </h4><br>
<p>In order to summon any boss, you will need to gather two element fragments, those can be found in the structure linked to the boss.
<br>Once you obtained the fragments, you will have to craft the boss' totem and use it on the boss summoner, which can be found in the boss arena.
<br>Be careful, the bosses are pretty strong so you will want to be with allies. in addition to that, you only get one lifen per boss,
if you die during the fight, you won't be abble to join it back and you will loose your stuff ( unlees the boss was part of an event).

<h4> Bosses list </h4><br>
<h2> Fire breather </h2><br>
<p>◆ A lot of legends were born with this specimen, usually it is said that this is the ghost of one of the fire titans who once created 
the underworld and gave to earthling the fire element. However it's just a ghast who spent it's entire life under the lava,
accumulating ignisium in it's system to extend it's life time and grow in size.<br>
◾ It fly far away from the warriors, shooting them with ignisium eyes, however it's size make it a very good target to shoot with a bow.<br>
◾ Once killed, it drops the ignisium stashed in it's mouth, utilized to create it's projectiles. It may also, for some unknown reasons, 
drop a disc of the music sang to babies in hope to turn them as heroic as the one who, riding a dinosaur, fighted the king of koopas.</p><br>
<h2> Dolphin king</h2><br>
<p>◆ Following deep researches, the scientific elves deduced that this specimen was, in fact, not a dolphin. Many theories exist, however the 
one believed by most is that the dolphin king is a very inteligent type of factice which copied the look of dolphin in order to live among them.
Because of it's size it's usually the leader of the dolphin group.<br>
◾ It will swim towards the warriors and attack them, it may be a very smart life form it sure sucks at fighting.<br>
◾ Sameas smaller factice, it will drop the aquatine constituing it's body. Sometimes, specimens eat discs dropped by the sacred train which was able to 
travel underwater.</p><br>
<h2> Spice </h2><br>
<p>◆ The master of spiders, it lives very high up in the mountains, nourishing itself with the nutiments found in the snow. Not carnivorous,
it only attack animals to protect itself. However, it uses the dead body of it's victim as fridges, filling them with snow to gain more nutriments.<br>
◾ The more it's alive, the stronger it gets. In fact, the Spice spit powder snow on the warriors and slowing them thanks to the cold.<br>
◾ As a last hope, the specimen froze it's body to death in order to make it's opponent unable to cultivate it's body, transforming it into crystallum.
When a specimen commited a lot of murders, the anger of it's victims sometimes crystalize into a disc.</p><br>
<h2> Unknown </h2><br>

◾ Unknown</p><br>
<h2> Wing giant </h2><br>
<p>◆Sometimes zombies get lost. Usually they end up in caves or in water, turning into drowned. However they sometimes, it's still unkwown as to how,
end up in the floating islands found over some oceans. When this happens, the local caelums choose it as their leader, doing so they let the zombie borrow
their wind powers. After usually a mont of co-existing, the zombie grew in size and learnt the ability to fly, becoming what is known as a wing giant.<br>
◾ This specimen run as fast as possible toward the warriors, flying over any obstacles, and doing a lot of damage. It's natural habit is the air, 
so as long as you stay on the ground, you should be alright.<br>
◾ The ventuma is the cistalisation of wind magic. Wind giant having borrowed this power for a long time, it is only logic to find a lot it on 
a wind giant corpse. When they are old enought, there's so many wind power in them that uppon dying they drop the emblematic theme of the so called
wind mage, the first earthling who managed to utilise the wind power.</p><br>
<h2> Fishnado </h2><br>
<p>◆ No one ever figured what this specimen was. It look like a fish however it isn't material like any other organism. When happy, it
take more of a pink tone to it and is as thin as light, you just can't toutch it. However, one angered, it get a more purple tone znd
to materialise, now being able to be toutched.<br>
◾ This flying entity is usually the last fight of warriors, believed to be as strong as a god this flying fish seems like untoutchable.
It is believed to be the stupidest yet strongest of the bosses, as a result we know only a little about it's fighting pattern, that being
it's method of attack : throwing salves of fulgurite balls, summoning lightning on the warriors so hard they seem to loose consciousness.<br>
◾ A specimen only live for a short time, in conclusion it usually dies of natural causes, in a happy unmaterial state, leaving nothing behind.
Only a few testimonies give us hints about what it leave in an angry state, apparenty it's death summon so many electricity it seems
to condense itself into fulgurite, questioning ourselves on how this stone is actually created. In addition to that, this boss
being usually the magnus opus of a warrior's carrer seems to congrats them with a pleasant and emotional disc.</p><br>

<h2 class="comic"> classified </h2><br>
<p class="comic">◆ This specimen appeared when after the creation a reality rift caused by the merge of 
every classic bosses loot, souls, netherite and every elemental ores.
 However the specimen created is too dangerous to study, trying to make us suffer because we k"illed it's brother".<br>
◾ DO NOT SUMMON IN ANY CIRCONSTANCES. IT'S HIGH SPEED, STRENGHT AND HEALTH MAKE THIS SPECIMEN ALMOST INVICIBLE.<br>
◾ Unknown </p><br>
