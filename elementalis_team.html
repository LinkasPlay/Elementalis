<h1> <br> About the team </h1>
<p>Yo it's us. <br> <p> <br>
<h2> Linkas </h2>
<p>Also known as Lukas, i'm a 18 yo guy. Right now i'm in an engineer school. 
<br>I've been playing this good old cube game since 2012, started playing
on xbox, now I play mostly on switch. 
<br>I'm the one getting the ideas for new features, 
I also work on the website and on the mod and do pretty much every textures.
In addition to that, I'm the one in charge of the discord server and of the in game moderation.
(if there's any problem i will usually be the one logging on). 
<br>In my long time playing, I did and saw a lot of things : I made way too many adventures map, 
worked on several litle "servers" during the console legacy times, played a lot of servers and realm. Because of this experience, I was able to
take what was good in every realm and servers I entoured, minus everyhing which made them terrible. For exemple, if there isn't any mod on the
server except our own, it's because having a balanced experience is very important to me. I don't want to see everyone with the same element because it's op,
eveyone using one armor because it's the best, etc. That's why we try to add as little weapons and armor as possible, trying to not make any
duplicate items (if I hate more ores so much, it's because there's no point adding this many ores if it's to give them all
the same crafts, you will never need to use silver, cobalt, etc cause blaze quartz is too strong, in conclusion some features are
straight up usless). 
<br>So, now you know my philosophy for the mod, making each and every addition fun and unique. As for the server in general, I just want 
everyone to have fun, while having an entertaining gameplay.
